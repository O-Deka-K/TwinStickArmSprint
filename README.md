# Twin Stick Swinger

## NOTE: THIS IS ONLY TESTED TO WORK ON INDEX.

On the Valve Index, the control scheme for Twin Stick and Armswinger actually don't interfere with each other. This allows both to be enabled at once without any compromises, and thus, Twinstick Swinger was born!

Twin Stick Swinger combines Twin Stick and Armswinger into one, providing the best of both worlds. Require the precision while handling a gun? Use the Twinstick controls. Want to run about? Press Armswinger controls! Why settle for one when you can get both?
