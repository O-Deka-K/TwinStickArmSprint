# TwinStick Arm Sprint

This is based on Potatoes' Twin Stick Swinger (https://github.com/potatoes1286/TwinStickSwinger). The main difference is that swinging your arms _only increases speed_, without affecting direction. It's similar to movement in Blade & Sorcery.

### NOTE: REPLACES ARMSWINGER MOVEMENT MODE

Due to issues caused by replacing Dash movement mode, this mod replaces Armswinger mode instead. It uses a combination of TwinStick options and Armswinger options.

## The following settings are respected

- TwinStick Options:
  - Movement Speed
  - Controller Forward/Side Root
  - TwinStick Left/Right Handedness
  - TwinStick Jump
- ArmSwinger Options:
  - ArmSwinger Jump
  - _**ArmSwinger Turning Mode**_

You can also use the Global Movement Options, like setting the buttons to turn or jump.

## The following settings are _ignored_

- TwinStick Options:
  - _**TwinStick Turning Mode**_
  - TwinStick Sprint Mode
  - TwinStick Sprint Toggle Mode
- ArmSwinger Options:
  - ArmSwinger Base Speed (Left Hand)
  - ArmSwinger Base Speed (Right Hand)

## Usage

1. Go to Wrist menu > Set Move Mode > **TS Arm Sprint**.
2. Use the analog stick (or touchpad on some controllers) on the movement hand to move around as in TwinStick mode.
3. Swing your arms to sprint. It doesn't matter which way you swing them. The faster you move, the faster you go!

## Notes

- Use _**ArmSwinger Turning Mode**_ to control the turning mode.
- If you have ArmSwinger Jump enabled, raise both controllers above your head to jump.
- If you have TwinStick Jump enabled, press down on the analog stick on the offhand to jump.
- Your max speed with the analog stick is set by the _**TwinStick Movement Speed**_ option.

## Fixed Issues

Several bugs were fixed compared to Twin Stick Swinger. Jump now works fine, whether you use TwinStick jump or Armswinger jump. Also, there's no awkward momentum issue when going down stairs.
