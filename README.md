# Twin Stick Swinger

## Exclusively designed for, and to work with Index. ~~Lesser~~ Other controllers, especially those with ~~inferior~~ fewer buttons in their control scheme, may not be able to use Twin Stick Swinger.

Twin Stick Swinger combines Twin Stick and Armswinger into one. It allows the speed of Armswinger and the precision of Twin Stick because their control schemes do not really interfere with eachother on the Index controllers.
